## ⚠️ Dev Version

**Do not use this branch in production projects.**  
Instead, use the **`master`** branch.

The `dev-version` branch is intended for debugging and development.

- Contains extra utilities for testing the module (e.g., `Driver.js`, `Driver1.js`).
- Includes additional UI helpers such as the `chalk` module.
- May contain experimental changes or errors.

If the module has any issues, clone this branch and help resolve them.
